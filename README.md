</p>

## Overview üåç

***galerkin*** is a powerful and extensible [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) framework designed for developing and testing advanced **finite element** formulations. It provides an integrated environment for simulating a variety of **2D/3D** **linear/nonlinear** **single/multi-physics** **single/multi-scale** problems in the **time/frequency** domain.

During the early stages of my PhD, I struggled with the complexity of a large-scale research code, and I faced major obstacles in implementing complex finite element formulations for fluid-structure interaction. This motivated me to create an **accessible** and **flexible** framework to facilitate rapid **development**, **testing**, and **deployment** of novel numerical methods. This code should be particularly beneficial for both early-career and experienced **researchers** striving to advance the field of **computational science and engineering**.

  - A formulation for the **fluid** sub-problem (`WeaklyCompressibleFlowDM_HDG` or `WeaklyCompressibleFlowVP_HDG`).

  - A formulation for the **structure** sub-problem (`Elasticity_CG`).

  - A formulation for the **moving mesh** algorithm (`Elasticity_CG`).

A key feature of ***galerkin*** is the simplicity of **monolithically coupling** $N$ different formulations, whose associated left-hand side matrix (LHS) and right hand side vector (RHS( are automatically combined at each Newton iteration as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{K}_{11} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{1N} \\
\vdots          & \ddots & \vdots          \\
\mathbf{K}_{N1} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{NN}
\end{bmatrix}^{k}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{1} \\
\vdots                \\
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}^{k+1}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{f}_{1} \\
\vdots         \\
\mathbf{f}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}^{k}
```

## Formulation Class üß©

The ease the implementation of new finite element methods, you can declare a new class (this is likely the only part of the code would need to touch!) that inherits from the base `Formulation` class.

Its main **properties** are:

- `NumGlobalComp`: Number of components for the global problem.

-  `computeInitialConditions()`: Computes the initial conditions.

- `buildBlock()`: Builds the LHS (diagonal block) and RHS of the specific (sub-)problem as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
      & \vdots          &       \\
\dots & \mathbf{K}_{ii} & \dots \\
      & \vdots          &

```

- `doPostProcess()`: Builds the LHS and RHS of the post-processing problem (for the HDG method).

## Numerical Methods üî¢

Here, a glimpse of the main numerical methods behind ***galerkin*** in given.

### Spatial Discretization üìê

- Element types: Triangles in 2D and Tetrahedra in 3D.

- Polynomial `Degree`: From order 1 to 8.

- `NodesDistribution`: 'Uniform' (equally spaced) and 'Fekete' (for better numerical conditioning).

### Time Integration ‚è≥

- [Backward Differentiation Formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_differentiation_formula) (BDF): From order 1 to 6. The BFD2 scheme is initialized with the backward Euler method (BDF1) at the first time step. Schemes with $\text{BDFOrder}$ > 2 can be merery used for convergence studies (when the analytical solution is available) and they are initialized with the solution at the times $t = ‚àín\Delta t$ with $n = [1,2,\dots,\text{BDFOrder}‚àí1]$.

- Predictor: Supports arbitrary order (e.g. 0 for a constant predition, 1 for linear extrapolation, etc.).

### Solvers & Preconditioners üßÆ

***galerkin*** allows the selection of various **solvers** and **preconditioners** to efficiently solve the resulting linear system.

- **Solvers**:

	- [`backslash`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/double.mldivide.html): MATLAB‚Äôs popular **\** operator to solve general linear systems of equations.

	- [`pcg`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pcg.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Preconditioned conjugate gradient** method for symmetric positive definite matrices.

	- [`minres`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/minres.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Minimum residual** method for symmetric and non-positive definite matrices.

	- [`gmres`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/gmres.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Generalized minimum residual** method for non-symmetric and non-positive definite matrices.

- **Preconditioners**:

	- [`ichol`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ichol.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Incomplete Cholesky** factorization.

	- [`ilu`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ilu.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Incomplete LU** factorization.

## Parallel Computing ‚ö°

***galerkin*** supports (limited) **parallel** capabilities. For instance, it leverages MATLAB's `parfor` to parallelize some element computations. You can achieve up to **~10x speedup** on relatively large-scale problems. For running a simulation on a cluster, you can adapt the `test.sh` file located in the main folder.

## Error Norms üìà

When developing novel finite element formulations, it is crucial to perform comprehensive error assessment to validate **model accuracy**. The framework supports multiple error norms:

- `Number` (i.e. scalar) norm computed in relative terms as
```math
\|E\| = \left|\dfrac{u^h-u^\text{ref}}{u^\text{ref}}\right|
```

- `L2` norm computed as
```math
\|E\|_{L^2(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{n_\text{el}}\int_{\Omega_e} \|\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2}
```

- `Hdiv` norm computed as
```math
\|E\|_{H^\text{div}(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{n_\text{el}}\int_{\Omega_e} \left(\|\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2+\|\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2\right)}
```

- `Hcurl` norm computed as
```math
\|E\|_{H^\text{curl}(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{n_\text{el}}\int_{\Omega_e} \left(\|\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2+\|\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2\right)}
```

## External Tools üõ†Ô∏è

Although ***galerkin*** is able to manage the main pre-processing, processing, and post-processing tasks, it can also leverage the functionalities of some external tools:

- **Free** software:

	- [**GMSH**](https://gmsh.info): An open-source software, ideal for **high-order mesh generation**.

	- [**ParaView**](https://www.paraview.org): The world‚Äôs leading open source **post-processing visualization engine**.

- **Licensed** software:

	- [**Advanpix**](https://www.advanpix.com): A **multiprecision computing toolbox** for MATLAB (supported for thermal problems only, but easily extendable).

	- [**Comsol Multiphysics**](https://www.comsol.com): A powerful and versatile **simulation software** (used for the solution of the unit cell problems for multi-scale computations).

## Getting Started üöÄ

From the main folder, run:
```matlab
run test.m
```
This command will execute all the scripts located in the `tests` folder, taking approximately 3 minutes to complete.

If all tests pass successfully, you could do worse than taking a look at the `main.m` file. This is organized in three sections: **Pre-processing**, **Processing** and **Post-processing**. Although quite lengthy (~1500 lines), it helps tracking the sequence of tasks from start to finish of the simulation.

You are then encouraged to have a look at some test files. Self-explanatory names are assigned to them to allow the user to easily find the features of interest. For example, `test_thermal_CG_2D.m` shows how to write the input file for a simple 2D thermal problem; `test_convergence_space_structured.m` can help in conducting a spatial convergence study; `test_plot_3D.m` shows how to generate plots to display the geometry, the mesh and the solution of a 3D problem; `test_error_norms.m` reveals how to consider different error norms; `test_paraview_timestep.m` shows how to export the solution computed at various time steps to paraview...

For a more complex example, I included the input and output of a popular fluid-structure interaction benchmark using two different formulations in `input/fsi_benchmark` and `output/fsi_benchmark`, respectively. When refining the mesh and reducing the time step size, you can reproduce the results in my PhD thesis[^3] and obtain this beautiful picture:
