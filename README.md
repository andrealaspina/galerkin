# Galerkin: A Flexible Finite Element Framework

## Overview üåç

Galerkin is a powerful and extensible [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) framework designed for developing and testing advanced **finite element** formulations. It provides an integrated environment for simulating a variety of **2D/3D** **linear/nonlinear** **single/multi-physics** **single/multi-scale** problems in the **time/frequency** domain.

At the beginning of my PhD, I struggled with the complexity of a large-scale research code, and I faced major obstacles in implementing complex finite element formulations for fluid-structure interaction. This motivated me to create an **accessible** and **flexible** framework to facilitate rapid **development**, **testing**, and **publication** of novel numerical methods. This should be particularly beneficial for both early-career and experienced **researchers** striving to advance the field of **computational science and engineering**.

## Features ‚ú®

Galerkin comes with a range of features designed to streamline the finite element simulation process:

- Automated workflow covering the main **pre-processing**, **processing**, and **post-processing** tasks.

- Support for multiple finite element **discretizations** (feel free to implement more!), including:

	- **Continuous Galerkin** (**CG**)

	- **Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin** (**HDG**)

	- Coupling between **CG** and **HDG**

- Broad applicability to various **physical models**.

- **Coupling** of an arbitrary number of sub-problems.

- Strong focus on **high-order** methods.

- (Limited) **parallel computing** capabilities leveraging MATLAB‚Äôs `parfor`.

- Seamless integration with **external tools** like [**GMSH**](https://gmsh.info), [**ParaView**](https://www.paraview.org), [**Comsol Multiphysics**](https://www.comsol.com), and [**Advanpix**](https://www.advanpix.com).

## Multiphysics Coupling üîÑ

Two strategies are implemented to facilitate multiphysics simulations:

- **Volume-based coupling**: Fully integrated physics within a single formulation (e.g., `MagnetohydrodynamicsCURL_HDG`, `MagnetohydrodynamicsCURLCURL_HDG`, `Plasma1FluidElectromagneticAdvanced_HDG`, etc.).

- **Surface-based coupling**: Interaction between sub-problems exchanging information on the interface. For instance, fluid-structure interaction problems are solved by coupling [^3]:

  - A formulation for the **fluid** sub-problem (`WeaklyCompressibleFlowDM_HDG` or `WeaklyCompressibleFlowVP_HDG`).

  - A formulation for the **structure** sub-problem (`Elasticity_CG`).

  - A formulation for the **moving mesh** algorithm (`Elasticity_CG`).

A key feature of Galerkin is the simplicity of **monolithically coupling** N different formulations, whose associated LHS and RHS are automatically combined as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{K}_{11} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{1N} \\
\vdots          & \ddots & \vdots          \\
\mathbf{K}_{N1} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{NN}
\end{bmatrix}^{i}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{1} \\
\vdots                \\
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}^{i+1}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{f}_{1} \\
\vdots         \\
\mathbf{f}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}^{i}
```
