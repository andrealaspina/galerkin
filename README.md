</p>

## Overview üåç

***galerkin*** is a powerful and extensible [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) framework designed for developing and testing advanced **finite element** formulations. It provides an integrated environment for simulating a variety of **2D/3D** **linear/nonlinear** **single/multi-physics** **single/multi-scale** problems in the **time/frequency** domain.

During the early stages of my PhD, I struggled with the complexity of large-scale research codes and faced significant challenges in implementing advanced finite element formulations for fluid-structure interaction. This motivated me to create an **accessible** and **flexible** framework that facilitates rapid **development**, **testing**, and **deployment** of novel numerical methods. This code is particularly beneficial for both early-career and experienced researchers striving to advance the field of **computational science and engineering**.

## Multi-physics Coupling üîÑ

Two strategies are implemented to tackle **multi-physics** problems:

- **Volume-based coupling**: Fully integrated physics within a single formulation (e.g., `MagnetohydrodynamicsCURL_HDG`, `MagnetohydrodynamicsCURLCURL_HDG`, `Plasma1FluidElectromagneticAdvanced_HDG`).

- **Surface-based coupling**: Interaction between sub-problems exchanging information at interfaces. For example, fluid-structure interaction problems couple [^2]:

  - A **fluid** formulation (`WeaklyCompressibleFlowDM_HDG` or `WeaklyCompressibleFlowVP_HDG`)

  - A **structure** formulation (`Elasticity_CG`)

  - A **moving mesh** formulation (`Elasticity_CG`)

A key feature of ***galerkin*** is the ability to **monolithically couple** $N$ different formulations, by automatically assembling their left-hand side matrix (LHS) and right-hand side vector (RHS) at each Newton iteration as:
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{K}_{11} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{1N} \\
\vdots          & \ddots & \vdots          \\
\mathbf{K}_{N1} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{NN}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{1} \\
\vdots                \\
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{f}_{1} \\
\vdots         \\
\mathbf{f}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}
```

## Project Structure üìÅ

## Data Types üìä

The data are essentially organized in structure arrays.

The structs defined in the **input file** are:

- `Boundaries(iD)`: Specifies the boundary splitting (edges in 2D, faces in 3D) for imposing boundary conditions.

- `Options`: Enables various features, such as plotting the geometry (`Options.PlotGeometry='yes'`), mesh and boundary conditions (`Options.PlotMesh='yes'`), or solution (`Options.PlotSolution={'VariableName'}`). Additional options include error computation (`Options.ComputeError={'VariableName'}`) and result saving/exporting.

The structs created in the **main file** are:

- `BCs(iD)`: Stores the nodes (relative to the underlying linear mesh) for boundary condition visualization.

- `Block`: Contains block-dependent data, including LHS, RHS, and matrix assembly indices.

- `Elements`: Organizes data in an element-wise manner for optimized `parfor` execution.

- `Faces(iD1,iD2)`: Stores face information for each sub-problem and interface coupling between different discretizations.

- `Memory`: Tracks memory usage during different simulation phases.

- `RefElement(iD1,iD2)`: Stores reference element data for each discretization and their coupling, including node coordinates, Gauss points, weights, and shape functions.

- `Sizes(iD)`: Stores discretization-dependent sizes, such as global/local component counts, number of elements, faces, and nodes.

- `Timer`: Records time spent on pre-processing, processing (evaluation, solution, local problems), and post-processing tasks.

## Formulation Class üß©

To facilitate the implementation of new finite element methods, ***galerkin*** allows you to declare a new class (likely the only part of the code you need to touch) that inherits from the base `Formulation` class.

Its main **properties** are:

Its main **methods** are:

-  `initializeUnknowns()`: Initializes the problem unknowns.

-  `computeInitialConditions()`: Computes the initial conditions.

- `buildBlock()`: Constructs the LHS (diagonal block) and RHS of the sub-problem as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
      & \vdots          &       \\
\dots & \mathbf{K}_{ii} & \dots \\
      & \vdots          &
\end{bmatrix}
\text{\quad and \quad}
\begin{bmatrix}
\vdots         \\
\mathbf{f}_{i} \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
```

- `doCoupling()`: Constructs the LHS coupling block (off-diagonal block) as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
      & \vdots          &       \\

      & \vdots          &
\end{bmatrix}
```

- `doPostProcess()`: Constructs the LHS and RHS of the post-processing problem.

## Numerical Methods üî¢

Here, a glimpse of the main numerical methods behind ***galerkin*** is given.

### Spatial Discretization üìê

- **Element type**: Triangles (2D) and Tetrahedra (3D)

- **Polynomial degree**: From order 1 to 8

- **Nodes distribution**: Uniform (equally spaced) and Fekete (for better numerical conditioning)

### Time Integration ‚è≥

- **Backward Differentiation Formulas** (BDF): From order 1 to 6. BDF2 is initialized with the backward Euler method (BDF1) at the first time step. Schemes with $\text{BDFOrder}$ > 2 are initialized (the analytical solution needs to be available!) with the solution at the times $t = ‚àín\Delta t$ with $n = [1,2,\dots,\text{BDFOrder}‚àí1]$

- **Predictor**: Arbitrary order (0 for constant prediction, 1 for linear extrapolation, etc.)

### Solvers & Preconditioners üßÆ

***galerkin*** allows the selection of various MATLAB built-in **solvers** and **preconditioners** to efficiently solve the resulting linear system:

- **Solvers**:

	- [`backslash`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/double.mldivide.html): MATLAB‚Äôs popular **\ operator** for general linear systems of equations

	- [`pcg`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pcg.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Preconditioned conjugate gradient** method for symmetric positive definite matrices

	- [`minres`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/minres.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Minimum residual** method for symmetric and non-positive definite matrices

	- [`gmres`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/gmres.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Generalized minimum residual** method for non-symmetric and non-positive definite matrices

- **Preconditioners**:

	- [`ilu`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ilu.html?s_tid=doc_ta): **Incomplete LU** factorization

### Error Norms üìà

When developing novel finite element formulations, it is crucial to perform a comprehensive error assessment to validate **model accuracy**. The framework supports multiple **error norms**:

- `Number` (i.e., scalar) norm computed in relative terms as
```math
\|E\| = \left|\dfrac{u^h-u^\text{ref}}{u^\text{ref}}\right|
```

- `L2` norm computed as
```math
\|E\|_{L^2(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{n_\text{el}}\int_{\Omega_e} \|\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2}
```

- `Hdiv` norm computed as
```math
\|E\|_{H^\text{div}(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{n_\text{el}}\int_{\Omega_e} \left(\|\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2+\|\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2\right)}
```

- `Hcurl` norm computed as
```math
\|E\|_{H^\text{curl}(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{n_\text{el}}\int_{\Omega_e} \left(\|\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2+\|\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^h-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^\text{ref}\|^2\right)}
```

## Parallel Computing ‚ö°

***galerkin*** supports (limited) parallel computing capabilities using MATLAB's `parfor` for element computations. It achieves up to ***~10x speedup*** on relatively large-scale problems.

For cluster execution, modify the `test.sh` script in the main folder.

## External Tools üõ†Ô∏è

Although ***galerkin*** can manage the main pre-processing, processing, and post-processing tasks, it can also leverage the functionalities of some external tools:

- **Free** tools:

	- [**GMSH**](https://gmsh.info): An open-source software, ideal for **high-order mesh generation**

	- [**ParaView**](https://www.paraview.org): The world‚Äôs leading open-source **post-processing visualization engine**
 
	- [**DistMesh**](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0036144503429121): A simple yet powerful unstructured **mesh generator** for MATLAB

- **Licensed** software:

	- [**Advanpix**](https://www.advanpix.com): A **multiprecision computing toolbox** for MATLAB

	- [**Comsol Multiphysics**](https://www.comsol.com): A powerful and versatile **simulation software**

## Getting Started üöÄ

Clone the **repository** by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrealaspina/galerkin.git
```

From the main folder, execute the following command in MATLAB's **Command Window**:
```matlab
run test.m
```
This command executes all scripts in the `tests/` folder in ~3 minutes.

If all tests pass successfully, start by exploring `main.m`, which is structured into three sections: **Pre-processing**, **Processing**, and **Post-processing**. Although lengthy (~1500 lines), this file helps track the sequence of tasks from start to end of the simulation.

Next, check out some **test files**, which are named descriptively for easy navigation.

For a simple one-way coupled multi-physics problem, check out the **thermo-mechanical** problem in `input/jet_engine_blade`, reproducing the [`Thermal Stress Analysis of Jet Engine Turbine Blade`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/ug/thermal-stress-analysis-of-jet-engine-turbine-blade.html) example in MATLAB's Partial Differential Equation Toolbox:
