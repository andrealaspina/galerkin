# Galerkin: A Flexible Finite Element Framework

## Overview üåç

Galerkin is a powerful, adaptable, and extensible [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) framework designed for the development and testing of advanced **finite element** formulations. It provides an integrated environment for simulating **2D/3D** **linear/nonlinear** **single/multi-physics** **single/multi-scale** problems in the **time/frequency** domain.

During my PhD, I grappled with the overwhelming complexity of a large-scale C++-based research code, facing major obstacles in implementing intricate hybrid finite element formulations for fluid-structure interaction. These frustrations fueled my determination to develop a more **accessible** approach to finite element research. My objective is therefore to provide a streamlined framework that enables rapid **development**, **testing**, and **publication** of new methodologies. This should be particularly beneficial for both early-career and experienced **researchers** striving to advance the field of **computational science and engineering**.

## Multiphysics Coupling üîÑ

Two strategies are implemented to facilitate multiphysics simulations:

- Volume-based coupling: Fully integrated physics within a single formulation (e.g., `MagnetohydrodynamicsCURL_HDG`, `MagnetohydrodynamicsCURLCURL_HDG`, `Plasma1FluidElectromagneticAdvanced_HDG`).

- Surface-based coupling: Interaction between subsystems. For instance, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems (see [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2020.113392](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2020.113392)) are solved by coupling:

  - A formulation for the fluid sub-problem (`WeaklyCompressibleFlowDM_HDG` or `WeaklyCompressibleFlowVP_HDG`).

  - A formulation for the structural sub-problem (`Elasticity_CG`).

  - A formulation for the moving mesh algorithm (`Elasticity_CG`).

A key feature of **Galerkin** is the simplicity of monolithically coupling N different formulations, whose associated LHS and RHS are automatically combined as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{K}_{11} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{1N} \\
\vdots          & \ddots & \vdots          \\
\mathbf{K}_{N1} & \dots  & \mathbf{K}_{NN}
\end{bmatrix}^{i}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{1} \\
\vdots                \\
\Delta \mathbf{u}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}^{i+1}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{f}_{1} \\
\vdots         \\
\mathbf{f}_{N}
\end{bmatrix}^{i}
```
