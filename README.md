# Galerkin: A Flexible Finite Element Framework

## Overview üåç

Galerkin is a powerful, adaptable, and extensible **MATLAB** framework designed for the development and testing of advanced **finite element** formulations. It provides an integrated environment for simulating **2D/3D** **linear/nonlinear** **single/multi-physics** **single/multi-scale** problems in the **time/frequency** domain.

During my PhD, I grappled with the overwhelming complexity of a large-scale C++-based research code, facing major obstacles in implementing intricate hybrid finite element formulations for fluid-structure interaction. These frustrations fueled my determination to develop a more **accessible** approach to finite element research. My objective is therefore to provide a streamlined framework that enables rapid **development**, **testing**, and **publication** of new methodologies. This should be particularly beneficial for both early-career and experienced **researchers** striving to advance the field of **computational science and engineering**.

## Features ‚ú®

Comprehensive workflow automation covering main **pre-processing**, **processing**, and **post-processing** tasks.
Support for multiple finite element discretizations, including:

- **Continuous Galerkin** (**CG**)

- **Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin** (**HDG**)

- Coupling between CG and HDG

Broad applicability to various physics models.

Coupling of an arbitrary number of sub-problems.

Flexible discretization, solver selection, and high-order methods.

Parallel computing capabilities leveraging MATLAB‚Äôs `parfor` construct.

Seamless integration with external tools like GMSH, ParaView, Comsol, and Advanpix.

For instance, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems are solved by coupling:
